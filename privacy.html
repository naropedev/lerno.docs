          <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how Lerno ("we", "us") processes information when you use the Lerno mobile app and related services
            (collectively, the "Service").
          </p>

          <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We may process the following categories of information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Account information:</strong> email address, username/login, and profile name (if provided).</li>
            <li><strong>User content:</strong> materials you upload or create in the Service (for example: PDFs, images, text notes, generated quizzes, and related metadata).</li>
            <li><strong>Study and usage data:</strong> learning activity such as streaks, completed sessions, answers, and statistics.</li>
            <li><strong>Device and diagnostics:</strong> device model, OS version, app version, crash logs, and basic diagnostics needed to improve reliability and security.</li>
            <li><strong>Network data:</strong> IP address and request metadata for security, abuse prevention, and troubleshooting.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription information:</strong> subscription status/entitlements as provided by the App Store. We do not receive or store your full payment card details.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
          <p>We use information to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide and operate the Service (accounts, sync, content processing, and generation).</li>
            <li>Process uploaded materials for OCR and AI generation as requested by you.</li>
            <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, and enforce limits and fair use rules.</li>
            <li>Provide customer support and respond to your requests.</li>
            <li>Improve performance, reliability, and user experience.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Sharing and Processing by Third Parties</h2>
          <p>
            To provide core functionality, we may share limited data with service providers acting as processors, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure providers</strong> (hosting, storage, databases, email delivery, and monitoring).</li>
            <li><strong>OCR providers</strong> to extract text from your uploaded materials.</li>
            <li><strong>AI/LLM providers</strong> to generate learning content based on the materials you submit.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not sell your personal information. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights, users, or the Service.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We retain information as needed to provide the Service. Uploaded materials may be stored for a limited time depending on your subscription plan
            and the Service settings (for example, "source storage" retention). We may retain certain logs for security and fraud prevention.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Security</h2>
          <p>
            We use reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect information (for example, encryption in transit and access controls).
            No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete certain information.
            You can request account deletion or data access by contacting us.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Children</h2>
          <p>
            The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child provided us personal information,
            contact us so we can take appropriate action.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the "Last updated" date and, if changes are material, provide additional notice as required.
          </p>
