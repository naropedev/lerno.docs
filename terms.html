            These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Lerno mobile app and related services (the "Service").
            By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>1. The Service</h2>
          <p>
            Lerno helps you create and practice learning content (for example, quizzes) based on materials you provide.
            Some features may use automated processing such as OCR and AI generation.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>You are responsible for keeping your account credentials secure.</li>
            <li>You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for activity that occurs under your account.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. User Content</h2>
          <p>
            You retain ownership of the content you upload or create ("User Content"). You grant us a limited license to host, process, and display your User Content
            as necessary to provide the Service (including OCR and AI generation you request).
          </p>
          <p>
            You represent that you have the rights to upload and process your User Content and that it does not violate laws or third-party rights.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
          <p>You agree not to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the Service for unlawful, harmful, or abusive purposes.</li>
            <li>Attempt to bypass limits, rate limits, or subscription restrictions.</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, exploit, or interfere with the Service or its security.</li>
            <li>Upload content that infringes IP rights or contains illegal material.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
          <p>
            Some features require a subscription. If you purchase a subscription through the App Store:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
            <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
            <li>You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your App Store account settings.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The app itself is licensed under Apple's Standard EULA (if you downloaded it from the App Store):
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/">Apple Standard EULA</a>.
            These Terms apply to the Service and any non-App Store components.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Availability, Changes, and Limits</h2>
          <p>
            We may change, suspend, or discontinue parts of the Service at any time. We may enforce fair use, rate limits, and plan limits to protect the Service and users.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may suspend or terminate access to the Service if you violate these Terms or if required to protect the Service, users, or comply with law.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
          <p>
            The Service is provided "as is" and "as available". We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.
            Generated content may contain mistakes; you are responsible for verifying it.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
            or any loss of data, profits, or revenues.
          </p>
